# Rsync-Backup-Script
My personal terminal input, in the form of a shell script, to sync my files with Rsync. This prevents me from forgetting my arguments or from having to type it out every time...

'backup' is for linux environments and 'backup.cmd' is for windows, if this was at all necessary to say. If anyone is lazy enough to need this for themselves, well, you can alter the file locations for your environment in a text editor.
